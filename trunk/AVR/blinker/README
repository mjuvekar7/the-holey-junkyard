blinker sub-directory
author: mandar, shardul

This is the README file located in the blinker sub-directory of the AVR
directory of the repository. It contains code for a very simple blinker program,
used primarily for testing. The directory has one sub-directory and seven files
as explained below:

Directories --
alternate/ 
    This directory contains source code and output files
    for a simple rpogram to have two LEDs blink in an alternate fashion.

Files --
blink.c 
    This is the actual source code for the program. It is a simple fragment of 
    code. Please read comments in the code in order to understand its working.

blink.hex and blink.elf
    These are the pre-compiled output files for the program ready to be burnt on
    an AVR.  Note: these files are compiled to work with an Atmega16 working at
    8MHz. These files can be recompiled and burnt using the Makefile.

blink.lst 
    This is a file showing the C code and assembly code for the program
    side-by-side. It is not practically useful, but shows how C code is
    translated into assembly instructions.

blink.out 
    This file is needed for the .lst file (see above).

Makefile 
    See README file in AVR directory for instructions on using the Makefile.

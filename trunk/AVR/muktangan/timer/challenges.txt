Challenges faced:

1. Required component not available --
The microcontroller we had designed the project on was not available, so we had to buy another one and redesign the project.

2. Code and circuit not developed synchronously --
We developed the code, and then the circuit. So, we had to debug the code and develop the circuit alongside to make them work together.

3. Power source problem --
An AC-DC adapter should have worked for the project, but such adapters do not give stable, clean output. We had to use DC power from AA batteries instead.

4. Driving the mechanical part of the project --
The circuit was ready, but the other part -- the mechanical latch -- was not. We had to drive AC mains using a relay triggered by our circuit.

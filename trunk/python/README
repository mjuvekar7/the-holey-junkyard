python directory
author: shardul

This is the README file located in the python directory of the SVN repository.
The directory has five files and no sub-directries. Its contents are explained
below:

fib.py
    A Python utility for Fibonacci numbers, which can give you the first n
    Fibonacci numbers, all Fibonacci numbers less than n, and next/previous
    Fibonacci numbers.

prime.py
    A Python utility for prime numbers, which can give you the first n
    prime numbers, all prime numbers less than n, and next/previous
    prime numbers. It can also factorize quite large numbers (into their prime
    factors) upto 20 digits long within a minute or so on a 1 GHz processor.

primes
    A Python pickled file of the first 100000 (one hundred thousand) primes. To
    use it, unpickle it as usual. This file is used by 'prime_time.py'.

prime_time.py
    A Python script to check how long it takes to factorize a random large
    semi-prime. A semi-prime is a number made by multiplying two primes
    together. Here, two random primes from the pickled 'primes' file are
    multiplied and the result is then factorized, measuring the timetaken to
    factorize it.

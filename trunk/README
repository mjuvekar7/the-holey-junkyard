This is the README file located in the top directory of the repository. The
directory has four sub-directories and one file, which are explained below:

Directories --
AVR/
    This directory contains built AVR microcontroller C code, with
    documentation. It is designed to work on the ATmega8 and the ATmega8535
    microcontrollers. The code demonstrates simple microcontroller operation,
    and a few sub-directories contain specific projects.

python/
    This directory contains Python code. It includes utilities which I have
    written in the Python language for various small purposes. There are no
    specific projects.

    Oddball directory containing very random stuff. Includes misc. bash scripts,
    3D models, videos, songs, scribble files, etc.

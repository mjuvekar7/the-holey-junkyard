VoteCounter directory
author: shardul

This is the README file in the VoteCounter directory of the repository. It has
four sub-directories and four files, each explained below:

Directories --
build/
    This sub-directory contains compiled sources (as '*.class' files). It also
    contains NetBeans build configuration data. This sub-directory is not meant
    to be tampered with directly; there is no README file.

dist/
    This sub-directory contains the built jarchive for the project, along with
    library dependancies.

nbproject/
    This sub-directory contains NetBeans project configuration data. This sub-
    directory is not meant to be tampered with directly; there is no README
    file.

src/
    This sub-directory contains the sources for the project (Java source files
    -- '*.java' -- and other resource files). They are well-commented and self-
    explanatory, so there is no README file.

Files --
build.xml
    This contains NetBeans build configuration.

COPYING
    This contains the GPL copyleft declaration for VoteCounter. This file is
    actually a link to src/votecounter/COPYING.

manifest.mf
    This is the NetBeans project Manifest file.

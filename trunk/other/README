other directory
author: shardul

This is the README file located in the other directory of the SVN repository.
The files in this directory keep changing as we need them, and so I won't
bother to explain each of them here as they are usually self-explanatory. The
ideas file, however, is permanent and will contain a list of ideas for future
work; it will be ever-expanding.

Bugs, tips, suggestions, requests to <shardul.chiplunkar@gmail.com> or
<mjuvekar7@gmail.com>.

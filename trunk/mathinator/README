This is the README file in the top directory of mathinator.

Welcome to mathinator, a free and open source math problem solver! mathinator is
designed to solve (read as 'parse' if you want to be technical) math word
problems in English using the standard processes of tokenization, grammar
parsing, and finally output synthesis. However, mathinator also uses a sort of
'preprocessor' in the sense that the problem is simplified to remove information
not directly relevant to the problem, like converting verb forms into their
roots.

If you thought mathinator is somewhat like a compiler for English, then you're
absolutely right! mathinator is built with PLY (Python Lex-Yacc, available at
dabeaz.com/ply), an implementation of the popular compiler-building tools lex
and yacc but in Python. mathinator also uses the text2num (available at
https://github.com/ghewgill/text2num) library to convert text into numbers.

mathinator is licensed under the GNU GPL.

A summary of the items in this folder --
 -- core.py: the main executing file, which builds the lexer and parser to parse
    the problem
 -- COPYING: mathinator's license
 -- globdict.py: the global dictionary of all names in the problem along with
    their attributes, and also of all keywords defined by modules
 -- infile: a trial input file
 -- modules/: the directory containing all the modules, along with a
    '__init__.py' file to do some housekeeping by condensing all the keywords
    into one dictionary
 -- parser.out and parsetab.py: files generated by PLY to speed up parsing by
    constructing the grammar only once (the first time it is built)
 -- ply/: the PLY library
 -- PLY_LICENSE: PLY's license
 -- preparer.py: the so-called 'preprocessor' for mathinator
 -- README: this file
 -- text2num/: the text-to-number conversion library
 -- TODO: future development plans

Currently the grammar might look too complicated, but this is about as
complicated as it will ever get. Future modules will define keywords as they
need them, and will also make changes to preparer.py (extra: invent a proper way
of doing this!) to cut out all the nonsense.

Synthesis of an answer in English is essential, but I believe this is easily
done. Also, writing a frontend for mathinator to Jasper (the Raspberry Pi open
source voice control software) would be nice.

The project needs a lot of serious documentation.
